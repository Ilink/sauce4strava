    The concept of power profiling was created by Dr. Andy Coggan.   It is a basic
    outline of the power requirements to be at a specific level of racing competitiveness.
    The levels are range from <i>Cat 5</i> (lower) to <i>World Class</i> (the highest).

    <br/><br/>

    These rankings are meant to give you a rough idea of how your best power output would
    compare to the maximum capability of other racers, so they are most representative when
    you are working very hard.

        The Strava Sauce algorithm is a modified from Andy's original spreadsheet
        so that it can estimate rankings for any time period.  For an in depth
