strava-sauce - Chrome Extension
===========

Supplements the web version of Strava.com to add some better power
information to the UI.

Disclaimer
--------

I don't work for Strava nor have I interacted with any persons from
Strava in the writing of this extension.  Much of the work is
inspired by the Strava Enhancement Suite, which I can also recommend
in conjunction with this extension.  All the information used in this
extension is readily available within the Strava.com website.
